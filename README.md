Climate Analysis Dashboard
- Overview
    The Climate Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based tool designed to help governments analyze historical climate data, predict future climate trends, and generate actionable policy recommendations. Powered by the SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, the dashboard enables users to forecast key climate variables like temperature and rainfall. In addition to forecasting, the tool suggests public policies backed by historical examples and scientific justification, making it an essential asset in mitigating the effects of climate change.

- Key Features
    Climate Forecasting Using SARIMA: Predicts minimum and maximum temperatures, as well as rainfall, for selected locations using historical data.
    Data-Driven Policy Recommendations: Generates tailored policy suggestions, such as water-saving initiatives or public health programs, based on forecasted trends.
    Interactive User Interface: Users can search for a location and view climate predictions in easy-to-interpret graphs.
    Evaluation and Reliability: The predictions are evaluated using metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) to ensure accuracy.

- Technologies Used
    Python: Core backend language.
    Flask: Web framework for building the interactive dashboard.
    Pandas & NumPy: For data processing and manipulation.
    Statsmodels: To implement SARIMA models for climate forecasting.
    Matplotlib: For visualizing climate data and forecast graphs.
    Folium: For creating interactive maps.
    Bootstrap: Responsive web design.
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For frontend structure and interactivity.

- Installation
    Prerequisites
    Python 3.x
    Pip

- Usage
    Search Climate Data: Enter a location (e.g., Sydney, Melbourne) into the search bar to retrieve and analyze historical climate data.
    View Forecasts: Once a location is selected, the dashboard will forecast future climate trends, including minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall, using the SARIMA model.
    Policy Recommendations: Based on the forecasted climate trends, the dashboard will generate relevant policy suggestions, each backed by historical data and real-world examples.

- Evaluation and Model Metrics
  Our SARIMA models are evaluated using several key metrics to ensure accuracy:

    Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors.
    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Captures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
    Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Reflects the accuracy as a percentage of the actual data values.
    These metrics provide a clear assessment of how reliable the predictions are, enhancing the trustworthiness of the policy recommendations generated.

- How It Works
    Data Processing: Historical climate data is processed and cleaned by resampling the data weekly and interpolating missing values. This ensures the data used in the SARIMA models is of the highest quality.
    Forecasting: The SARIMA models are applied to predict future climate conditions based on historical trends. The results are displayed in intuitive graphs.
    Policy Generation: Each forecast is paired with policy suggestions, such as flood defenses, heatwave preparedness, or water conservation measures. These policies are backed by real-world case studies, ensuring relevance and effectiveness.
